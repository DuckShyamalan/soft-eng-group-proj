# Time Management

Time Management is a key skill for any team and as such, we have made efforts to utilise our time effectively considering the weight of the tasks we had and everyone's schedule. 
We had allotted estimates to our various tasks and set ourselves a few hours of work a day.
We had gone over our estimated hours for many of the tasks but we built contingency time into our sprint plans which enabled us to finish on time despite our setbacks.

As demonstrated in our different burndown charts, in the first two sprints, we carried over some of our tasks to the next sprint, namely "Importing files" and "Fullscreen chart mode", both of which we managed to complete by the final hand-in and by the last sprint, we had intentionally given ourselves a good number of extra tasks to do so that we would always have something to do.
As a result, we had a little under 20 hours of scheduled additional tasks remaining.
This was discussed with our product owner during all stages of the project whose approval we received.
Overall, we found the burndown charts to be very handy as they allowed us to keep an eye on our workload during sprints, as enabled us to review our performance.

Approximately, each person had spent around 10 hours a week and this value would be higher during the latter portion of the sprint due to tasks like debugging, testing, and working on the documentation.
We did not do any work over the Easter break as was advised to us.

A great amount of time went into the backend: providing data, creating charts, etc.
But the most amount of time went into the making of the GUI, particularly the different views of the GUI.
The particular tasks as labelled in our Product Backlog which took us the most time were:

- Table/query view
- Provide chart data in Query Engine
- Graph filtering GUI/backend
- Display charts
- Comparative charts

We estimated our user stories using story points (using doubles for user stories: 1, 2, 4, 8,...) and estimated our task completion time in hours (using even numbers).
This helped us provide good estimates for our tasks and decide how much we could realistically do as well as helped us with personal allotment of time to each task per day.
We had initially provided estimates for all of the items in our product backlog but modified them during each sprint.

Each team member was initially assigned to certain tasks and if they were working on a relatively lower effort or less time consuming task, they would move over to help another team member working on a relatively more time consuming task thereby putting buddy programming in place as well as making sure that each person puts in similar amounts of work.

We consider to have managed our time reasonably well and have gradually improved over the latter sprints by trying to balance this and our additional commitments as well but wish we had done more work over the earlier sprints so that we could spend the latter period of time with more extensions or testing and bug fixing.
