# Evaluation of Team Skills

Our team worked well together from the start, but became more cohesive as the project progressed.
Initially, we split up work more and came together to link together our pieces of the puzzle to produce the finished product, but as the project progressed, we modified our work style to be more collaborative, meeting more regularly, developing aspects of the app together in the same physical room and taking full advantage of our collective abilities.

We utilised pair programming much more often and effectively towards the end of the project, which drastically improved the quality of our code, reducing the number of bugs we introduced and improving our approach to problems.
Meeting more often (every 2-3 days in latter sprints) meant we were more aware of what other members of the team were working on.
The increased level of communication improved the overall knowledge of the codebase of all members of the team, meaning we could help each other out more effectively, and we weren't reliant on the knowledge of individuals in the team to develop a part of the app that only they could understand, since we all understood the whole codebase well.

We also noticed just how much more we communicate to each other in-person.
We feel this helped us ensure the voices and opinions of all members of the team were heard and taken into account before we came to an agreement on a course of action.
This just doesn't happen in the same way in text chat, as people are less likely to get involved in discussion, and sometimes feel their messages might be misinterpreted.

Right from the start, we took full advantage of burndown charts, which really helped us to keep track of our workload during sprints.
At the end of a sprint, we built a detailed burndown from data collected by Azure DevOps during sprints (see the *Tools and Communication* section).
This helped us see which areas of the app we had over or underestimated the time and effort needed to complete so we could estimate better in future sprints.
As a team, we found the analytics available on Azure DevOps extremely useful for keeping track of our individual workloads, so we could be sure all members of the team were doing their part and no member was overloaded with work.

Having regular feedback sessions with our supervisor kept everyone on the same page about where we were, and where we were headed.
Our supervisor sometimes asked for changes in the GUI to improve usability, and once pointed out a feature that we had misinterpreted.
His regular feedback and guidance was vital to ensuring we produced an app that was fit for purpose.

Towards the end of each sprint, we met more regularly as a group, sitting down together to finalise the product. This improved our productivity drastically through increased communication, and helped us ensure that everyone was happy with the final build before we submitted our product.
For this to work, it was important that everyone felt comfortable speaking up if they thought something could be improved.
We feel we achieved a healthy work environment in which everyone had the courage to speak up with the assurance that they wouldn't be judged if they were mistaken.
