# Conclusion and Advice to Next year's Students

Our advice to future students is to start by setting up proper tools for tracking progress and work that still needs to be done, we've personally used Azure DevOps which allowed us to always know which tasks needed to be done and how many hours were left.

Buddy working also proved very useful in working at some tasks, as strange as it may seem to have two people working on one task instead of two separate tasks it's actually very efficient because downtime is minimized as you're never really stuck on a particular problem.

As for the actual coding part, if we were to do the module again we would not use Java Swing but instead spend more time researching Java FX to then use it for our project. 
Students should be aware that Java FX presents a significant learning curve, but we feel this would have be worth it for many of the features it provides that would have been extremely useful to us, especially later on in the project where we ran into great difficulty getting our Swing GUI to play ball.

We also advise future students to keep in close contact with both their group members and their supervisors as communication is key in a group project.
While working from the comfort of your home might seem tempting, it's a lot more efficient to actually meet in person, sit at the same table or at least work in the same room.
This way, if there is a problem, you don't have to worry about how to communicate with your team to solve it because your team is already there to help you get through it.

Another key point is that your supervisor is your product owner, and thus they are who you should be trying to please first and formost with your app.
If they don't like it, that's a big problem, so make sure you keep them informed about what you're doing, and keep them involved in all the key design decisions of your app (depending on their schedule, of course).
We had very few problems arranging regular meetings with our supervisor, but if you do, it's important to communicate your concerns early on to them, (and to the module leader if problems persist). The earlier you resolve issues like this, the better things are for you and your team. 
This extends to any issues you may have with other members of your team, though thankfully we had no problems. 
This doesn't mean pointing fingers, just getting the problem solved so you can produce the best products possible at the end of your sprints.


Git branching is also extremely important; don't just put everything on master!
Right from the start we had strict rules for branch merging. The master branch was protected and nothing could be pushed to it without passing a lot of automated tests through GitHub's branch protection rules and pull request functionality.
Don't be afraid to commit little and often, even if you're not entirely finished with some functionality, and especially early on.
This makes it easy to revert to an earlier version if you break something, or compare versions to see what you've changed.
We also recommend you get a Git GUI client, especially if you're new to Git (see the *Tools and Communication* section); it will make using Git much easier for a beginner, especially if you're not used to using the terminal regularly.

To conclude, Agile tools and methods, such as Scrum and XP, have been core to our approach to this project, helping us manage our workflow in ways we could not have forseen, and to a degree that surprised us.
We all feel we have learnt a lot, and look forward to continuing to develop our skills in this area in future collaborative projects.
